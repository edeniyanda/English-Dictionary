# English-Dictionary-Lookup
This repository contains a simple Python script that allows users to look up definitions of English words. The script uses the "difflib" library to find close matches for words that are not in the dictionary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use the script, clone this repository and run the following command:

python dictionary.py

You will be prompted to enter a word, and the script will print the definition if it is found in the dictionary. If the word is not found, the script will suggest similar words that might be what you were looking for.

## Data

The data for this project was taken from the [Webster English Dictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary/blob/master/dictionary_compact.json).
